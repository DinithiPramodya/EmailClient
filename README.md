# CLI based Emain Client Project

## A command-line based email client project developped using Java, which is able to send personalized birthday greetings

This project implements a command-line based email client, allowing users to manage recipients, send emails, and greet recipients on their birthdays. The application supports two types of recipients: official and personal. Recipient details are stored in a text file, and users have the option to update this file by adding new recipients through the command line. The system maintains recipient objects, and on a recipient's birthday, a birthday greeting is sent. Different messages are sent to official friends and personal recipients. All emails sent are saved using object serialization. Users can retrieve information about emails sent on a specific date using command-line options. The application also provides functionalities for adding recipients, sending emails, listing recipients with birthdays on the current date, and displaying email details based on user input. The project emphasizes object-oriented principles, coding best practices, and proper use of file handling and serialization.
